### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julian Oes, a PX4 developer and MAVSDK maintainer. I'm Swiss :switzerland:, living in New Zealand :new_zealand:.

**Open-source contributions:**

- :helicopter:  I have been a [PX4](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot) developer and open source contributor since 2012.
- :books: In 2016 I started work on [MAVSDK](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK), and I've been working on it ever since, initially sponsored by various companies, more recently in my spare time. I maintain it together with [Jonas Vautherin](https://github.com/JonasVautherin).
- :radio: I also help maintain and evolve [MAVLink](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink).
- :computer: I've contributed to [QGroundControl](https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol), as well as [NuttX](https://github.com/apache/nuttx).

**Community help and maintenance:**

- :speech_balloon: In my day to day I spend a considerable amount of time trying to help out in the community and answer questions. If you have asked questions on PX4 [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Dronecode) or [Discuss](https://discuss.px4.io/) you might have come across my name.

- :bug: I also try to stay on top of any MAVSDK issues and bugs as they come up and address them as soon as possible, at least as much as that's possible in my spare time.

If you benefit from any of the things I do, or want to allow me to spend more time working on open source in general or MAVSDK features and todos specifically, or just support me and my family :baby:, consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/julianoes) me!
